# Code of Conduct — No Assholes Rule

We’re building a welcoming, community-run service any town can host. We value kindness, clarity, curiosity, and high-quality, self‑tested contributions. Tests are adored and appreciated in this repo.

## Our Pledge
- Foster a friendly, inclusive environment for contributors of all backgrounds and experience levels.
- Prioritize empathy, collaboration, and pragmatism over ego or gatekeeping.

## The “No Assholes” Rule
- Don’t be a jerk. No harassment, insults, personal attacks, or belittling.
- No gatekeeping or dismissive behavior ("just read the code", "trivial").
- Assume good intent; ask clarifying questions; disagree respectfully.
- Keep feedback specific, actionable, and kind. Critique code, not people.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include: harassment or hate speech, sustained disruption, doxxing, unprofessional or demeaning comments, or repeated pushback after a maintainer decision.

## AI Assistance and Tests
- If you use AI to help write code, also use it to help write tests for that code. Ship both.
- Disclose AI use in the PR description (briefly: what, where, model/tool if known).
- Verify outputs locally. Do not rely on unvetted AI results: run, read, and refine.
- Respect licenses and privacy: do not paste secrets or proprietary content into tools; ensure generated code is compatible with this project’s license.
- Prefer small, readable diffs with clear test coverage or runnable examples.

Minimum acceptance bar for AI‑assisted changes:
- Include tests or a reproducible manual test plan covering happy path and at least one error path.
- Keep behavior and error shapes consistent with existing functions.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies in all project spaces (issues, PRs, discussions, reviews, and any community channels) and when representing the project in public.

## Reporting and Enforcement
- If you experience or witness misconduct, report it by opening an issue labeled `conduct` or by contacting the maintainers privately if available. Provide context and links when possible.
- Maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warnings, edits, discussion locks, or temporary/permanent bans from participation.
- Repeated or severe violations will result in escalated actions.

## Maintainers’ Responsibilities
- Model respectful behavior and enforce this Code of Conduct consistently and fairly.
- Clarify standards in discussions and reviews; explain moderation actions when possible.
- Favor de‑escalation and education first; protect contributors who report issues.

## Acknowledgements
Inspired by the “No Assholes Rule” ethos and common open‑source codes of conduct, adapted for a civic, community‑run project with a focus on tested quality.
